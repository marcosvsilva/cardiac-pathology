### Data Mining: First Assignment Predicting Cardiac Pathology

The main goal of this work is to apply feature importance methods to rank variables that are more predictive of cardiac pathologies. Before trying to achieve this goal, it may be necessary to preprocess the data. For example, data cleaning, data transformation, data normalization, as well as removal of irrelevant features, will be needed to help improving data quality.

The following is a description of the original data that was made available for the proposed solution.

Which has the following characteristics.

With numerous data processing, normalization and data cleansing, we were able to obtain a set of data with the following characteristics.

This data model enabled us to achieve a predictive tree model, which obtained an accuracy of 93%, to better understand all the procedures performed, I suggest that you read the article of publication of the work in Portuguese that deals with all stages of processing and data mining.
